# Midterm Project!!

Walkthrough of Jambo's Habitat :]
---
Intro page!

*Pick your fighter; which side of me would you like to see? Artist, Developer, or Game Designer?*

1. Artistic Habitat
    * The juicier part -- more projects there! 


2. Developer Habitat
    * Not much content -- what kind of projects would you add here anyways ):


3. Game Developer Habitat
    * Mixture of both, since it requires both, y'know..

All the pages will have the same format and style, but with their own touch and descriptions, backgrounds, doodles, and etc. (if time is on my side..)

Did not focus on JavaScript, for now, as I wanted to completely understand the foundations of HTML/CSS + and I'd love to use REACT on my portfolio, too :3

For the Week 10 HW, I somewhat fixed the NavBar functionality. It's yet to be perfect, but it's better
