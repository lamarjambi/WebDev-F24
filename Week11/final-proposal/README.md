# Final Proposal Pitch :3

Where does the portfolio stand, as of now?
- Artist page pretty much complete
- Basic layouts done
- JavaScript for draggable navBar

For the final, I will..
- Have custome background art and cursors for each page
- Finish intro cards art
- Incorporate animation--
    - Doodles pops when hovering over sections
    - Fixing draggable navBar (again)
    - Interactive sticky-notes for users to comment on projects! 
-  Make projects look more playing card-like 
- Have more media queries ):
